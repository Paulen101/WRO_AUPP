## üéØ What We Built

This repository holds all the engineering work behind our autonomous vehicle for the **WRO Future Engineers competition 2025**. We've built a car that can see, think, and drive completely on its own - no remote control, no human input, just pure autonomy.

**What makes it special:**

Our car drives itself from start to finish without any help, spotting and avoiding obstacles in real-time using advanced computer vision to recognize red and green pillars. It makes smart decisions while navigating through challenges, all powered by fine-tuned control systems that keep everything smooth and fast.

## üöÄ How We Built It

Building our autonomous vehicle was quite the journey - lots of trial and error, late nights debugging, and those "aha!" moments when everything finally clicked. Here's how we turned our crazy idea into reality:

### **Choosing Our Hardware**
We had to be smart about every component since we're students on a budget (aka broke), but we also needed serious performance. Also these components are also selected by our coach as well because he knows everything.

- **The Brain**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super - This little computer is honestly incredible. It's got ARM64 architecture with AI acceleration that lets us run our machine learning models without breaking a sweat
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS - We chose this because it's rock-solid stable, and we needed something that wouldn't crash during competitions
- **The Eyes**: Intel RealSense D455 camera - This was a game-changer for us. It gives us both regular color vision and depth perception, so our car can actually "see" in 3D
- **Balance and Navigation**: BNO055 IMU sensor that tells us exactly how our car is tilted, turning, or moving. Think of it as our car's inner ear
- **Movement**: Custom motor setup with encoders - We needed precise control, so we went with motors that can tell us exactly where they are and how fast they're spinning
- **The Body**: We 3D-designed and printed our own chassis. After breaking a few prototypes, we finally got one that could handle all our gear and look good doing it

### **Writing the Software**
This is where things got really interesting (and mathematical, if we're being honest):

We didn't just jump into coding - our coach taught us the theory behind everything first. We spent hours going through equations, learning about different algorithms and methods that could work for autonomous navigation. Then came the fun part: experimenting with these concepts ourselves, both independently and with our coach's guidance.

- **The Foundation**: ROS2 Humble became our best friend - it's like having a universal translator that lets all our different components talk to each other seamlessly
- **Teaching It to See**: We spent weeks training YOLOv8 AI models to spot those red and green pillars. We used both YOLOv8s and YOLOv8n versions, created our own dataset by taking hundreds of photos in different lighting conditions, and then optimized everything into .engine files so it runs super fast on our Jetson
- **Making It Drive Smoothly**: PID controllers sound simple in theory, but wow, did we spend countless hours tweaking those parameters and working through the math behind them. Our coach helped us understand the equations that make these controllers work, then we experimented with different tuning methods. Every tiny adjustment changed how our car behaved, but once we got it right, it felt like magic
- **Putting It All Together**: We built algorithms that take input from our camera, IMU, and motor sensors, then make split-second decisions about where to go and how fast to get there. This involved lots of mathematical calculations and algorithmic thinking that our coach guided us through
- **Keeping It Safe**: We learned the hard way to always have backup plans. Emergency stops, error recovery, and fail-safes became our saving grace during those "oh no" moments

### **Making Everything Work Together**
The real challenge wasn't building individual parts - it was getting them to play nice together. We spent weeks calibrating sensors, testing under different lighting conditions, and fine-tuning everything until our car could handle whatever the competition threw at it. Every bug we fixed and every improvement we made brought us closer to having something we could be truly proud of.

## üîß What Our Car Can Do

### **Driving Itself**
- Follows walls to navigate the track smoothly
- Uses an AI model to keep track of obstacles and avoid them
- Uses sensors and algorithms to stay in bounds
- Adjusts speed based on what's ahead

### **Seeing and Understanding**
- **Pillar Detection**: Spots red and green pillars even when lighting changes
- **Depth Vision**: Knows exactly how far away things are
- **AI-Powered Tracking**: Uses machine learning to monitor and predict obstacle movements

### **Smart Control**
- **Steering**: PID controllers we fine-tuned until they were perfect
- **Speed**: Knows when to go fast and when to slow down
- **Safety**: Emergency stops when something unexpected happens

---

## üèÅ How It Performs

Right now, our car can handle:

1. **Open Challenge**: Completing laps autonomously with smooth, optimized racing lines
2. **Obstacle Challenge**: Avoiding obstacles while maintaining good speed
   - *Note: We're still working on the parking part - it's integrated but not quite there yet*

### **The Numbers**
- **Speed**: Fast enough to be competitive, smart enough to stay safe (but still hit the wall during test)
- **Vision Range**: Can see obstacles and pillars from a good distance
- **Response Time**: Reacts in real-time (under 100ms)
- **Accuracy**: Rarely misses a pillar, even in tricky lighting

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Journey

### **Starting Small**
We began with simpler setups - a Raspbot with omniwheels and a TurtleBot3 - just to get our feet wet with robotics and understand how ROS2 works.

### **Going Custom**
Once we felt confident, we decided to build everything from scratch using the Jetson Orin Nano. This is where things got real.

### **Learning the Hard Way**
- Had to learn ROS2 and Linux from zero (lots of late nights!)
- Spent countless hours debugging camera issues and motor control
- Rebuilt our chassis more times than we care to admit
- But every problem taught us something new

### **Making It Work**
- Fine-tuned our PID controllers until the car drove like a dream
- Got our vision system to reliably spot pillars in all kinds of lighting
- Integrated all our sensors so they work together seamlessly
- Built something we're genuinely proud of

---

## üèÜ What Makes It Special

- **100% Autonomous**: Once it starts, we don't touch it - the car handles everything
- **Smart Vision**: Recognizes pillars even when the lighting isn't perfect
- **Easy to Upgrade**: We designed it so we can easily add new features or improve existing ones

*This represents months of hard work, learning, and problem-solving. We started with a simple goal - build a car that could drive itself - and ended up with something that genuinely impressed us. Hope it inspires you too!*
