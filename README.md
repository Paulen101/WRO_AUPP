## üéØ What We Built

This repository holds all the engineering work behind our autonomous vehicle for the **WRO Future Engineers competition 2025**. We've built a car that can see, think, and drive completely on its own - no remote control, no human input, just pure autonomy.

**What makes it special:**

Our car drives itself from start to finish without any help, spotting and avoiding obstacles in real-time using advanced computer vision to recognize red and green pillars. It makes smart decisions while navigating through challenges, all powered by fine-tuned control systems that keep everything smooth and fast.

## üöÄ How We Built It

Building our autonomous vehicle was quite the journey - lots of trial and error, late nights debugging, and those "aha!" moments when everything finally clicked. Here's how we turned our crazy idea into reality:

### **Choosing Our Hardware**
We had to be smart about every component since we're students on a budget (aka broke), but we also needed serious performance. Also these components are also selected by our coach as well because he knows everything.

- **The Brain**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super - This little computer is honestly incredible. It's got ARM64 architecture with AI acceleration that lets us run our machine learning models without breaking a sweat
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS - We chose this because it's rock-solid stable, and we needed something that wouldn't crash during competitions
- **The Eyes**: Intel RealSense D455 camera - This was a game-changer for us. It gives us both regular color vision and depth perception, so our car can actually "see" in 3D
- **Balance and Navigation**: BNO055 IMU sensor that tells us exactly how our car is tilted, turning, or moving. Think of it as our car's inner ear
- **Movement**: Custom motor setup with encoders - We needed precise control, so we went with motors that can tell us exactly where they are and how fast they're spinning
- **The Body**: We 3D-designed and printed our own chassis. After breaking a few prototypes, we finally got one that could handle all our gear and look good doing it

### **Writing the Software**
This is where things got really interesting (and mathematical, if we're being honest):

We didn't just jump into coding - our coach taught us the theory behind everything first. We spent hours going through equations, learning about different algorithms and methods that could work for autonomous navigation. Then came the fun part: experimenting with these concepts ourselves, both independently and with our coach's guidance.

- **The Foundation**: ROS2 Humble became our best friend - it's like having a universal translator that lets all our different components talk to each other seamlessly
- **Teaching It to See**: We spent weeks training YOLOv8 AI models to spot those red and green pillars. We used both YOLOv8s and YOLOv8n versions, created our own dataset by taking hundreds of photos in different lighting conditions, and then optimized everything into .engine files so it runs super fast on our Jetson
- **Making It Drive Smoothly**: PID controllers sound simple in theory, but wow, did we spend countless hours tweaking those parameters and working through the math behind them. Our coach helped us understand the equations that make these controllers work, then we experimented with different tuning methods. Every tiny adjustment changed how our car behaved, but once we got it right, it felt like magic
- **Putting It All Together**: We built algorithms that take input from our camera, IMU, and motor sensors, then make split-second decisions about where to go and how fast to get there. This involved lots of mathematical calculations and algorithmic thinking that our coach guided us through
- **Keeping It Safe**: We learned the hard way to always have backup plans. Emergency stops, error recovery, and fail-safes became our saving grace during those "oh no" moments

### **Making Everything Work Together**
The real challenge wasn't building individual parts - it was getting them to play nice together. We spent weeks calibrating sensors, testing under different lighting conditions, and fine-tuning everything until our car could handle whatever the competition threw at it. Every bug we fixed and every improvement we made brought us closer to having something we could be truly proud of.

## üîß What Our Car Can Do

### **Driving Itself**

Think of our car as having learned to drive just like a human would, but maybe even better. It naturally follows the walls to find its way around the track, almost like running your hand along a hallway in the dark. While it's doing this, it's constantly watching out for those red and green pillars, spotting them from a distance and smoothly steering around them without breaking a sweat. The car has this incredible sense of where it belongs on the track - it just knows not to wander off course. What really impresses us is how it reads the situation ahead and decides whether to speed up through open areas or slow down when things get tricky, kind of like how you'd naturally adjust your pace when walking through a crowded room versus an empty hallway.

### **Seeing and Understanding**

Our car's vision is honestly pretty amazing - it's like giving it a pair of really smart eyes that never get tired. It can spot those red and green pillars from way across the room, even when the lighting is being weird or there are shadows everywhere. But it's not just seeing them - it actually understands how far away everything is, kind of like having built-in depth perception that's probably better than ours. The coolest part is how it uses machine learning to not just see what's there right now, but to predict where things might move next, almost like it's thinking ahead about what the obstacles might do.

### **Smart Control**

The way our car controls itself feels almost human-like, but probably more precise than most of us could ever be. We spent ages fine-tuning these PID controllers until they were just right - now the steering is so smooth it's like the car just naturally knows where to go. It has this intuitive sense of when to floor it on the straightaways and when to ease up before a tricky turn, kind of like an experienced driver who's driven the same route a thousand times. And just like any good driver, it always has its finger on the brake - if something unexpected pops up, it can stop on a dime to keep everyone safe.

## üèÅ How It Performs

Right now, our car can handle:

1. **Open Challenge**: Completing laps autonomously with smooth, optimized racing lines
2. **Obstacle Challenge**: Avoiding obstacles while maintaining good speed
   - *Note: We're still working on the parking part - it's integrated but not quite there yet*

### **The Numbers**
When it comes to speed, our car has found that sweet spot where it's fast enough to actually compete but smart enough not to be reckless - though we'll be honest, it still occasionally kisses the wall during testing (we're working on that!). The vision system can spot obstacles and pillars from impressively far away, giving it plenty of time to plan its moves. What really blows our minds is how quick it thinks - we're talking reaction times under 100 milliseconds, which is faster than most humans can even blink. And here's something we're genuinely proud of: it almost never misses spotting a pillar, even when the lighting conditions are being absolutely terrible and would probably fool us.

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Journey

### **Starting Small**
We began with simpler setups - a Raspbot with omniwheels and a TurtleBot3 - just to get our feet wet with robotics and understand how ROS2 works.

### **Going Custom**
Once we felt confident, we decided to build everything from scratch using the Jetson Orin Nano. This is where things got real.

### **Learning the Hard Way**
We had to start from scratch with ROS2 and Linux, which meant plenty of late nights figuring out how everything worked. Debugging camera issues and getting the motor control just right took more time than we expected, and we definitely went through a few chassis designs before landing on one that actually worked well. But honestly, every challenge we hit taught us something valuable, and looking back, those problem-solving sessions were where we learned the most.

### **Making It Work**
Getting our PID controllers dialed in took patience, but once we found the right settings, the car's driving became really smooth and predictable. We put a lot of effort into making our vision system reliable across different lighting conditions, and it was satisfying to see it consistently spot those pillars. The real achievement was getting all our sensors to work together seamlessly - when everything finally clicked into place, we knew we had built something solid that we could be proud of.

## üèÜ What Makes It Special

- **100% Autonomous**: Once it starts, we don't touch it - the car handles everything
- **Smart Vision**: Recognizes pillars even when the lighting isn't perfect
- **Easy to Upgrade**: We designed it so we can easily add new features or improve existing ones
