Vehicle Photos
====

This folder is a complete photo gallery of our autonomous vehicle, showing it from every important angle so you can really get a sense of its design and build quality. Whether you're curious about the details or want to see how everything fits together, these images have you covered.

Here's what you'll find inside:

- **Front_robot.jpeg** – A clear shot of the car from the front, showing off the sensors and the main body.
- **Back_robot.jpeg** – The rear view, where you can see the motor setup and how the wiring is managed. (Apologize for the messy wiring!)
- **Side_robot1.jpeg** and **Side_robot2.jpeg** – Both sides of the vehicle, so you can check out the profile, wheel placement, and any side-mounted components.
- **Top_Robot.jpeg** – A bird’s-eye view that reveals the overall layout, including the placement of the main board, battery, and camera.
- **Under_robot.jpeg** – The underside of the car, showing the chassis, wiring, and how everything is mounted underneath.

These photos are meant to make it easy for anyone to understand how our vehicle is put together, whether you're building your own, reviewing our work, or just want a closer look at the engineering. If you need more detail or want to see a specific part, let us know!
