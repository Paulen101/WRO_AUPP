Electromechanical Diagrams
====

This directory contains all the key diagrams and images that document the hardware and wiring of our autonomous vehicle. These files are essential for understanding how the electronic components, sensors, and motors are connected and how the system is physically assembled.

**Files included:**

- **Schematic.jpeg**  
	This is the main wiring schematic for our vehicle. It shows all the electronic components—such as the Jetson Orin Nano, motor drivers, sensors, power supply, and other modules—and how they are electrically connected. If you want to replicate or troubleshoot the system, this diagram is your go-to reference.

- **Board.jpeg**  
	This image is a top-down view of our main circuit board. It helps you see the physical layout of the components and the wiring as it appears in the real build, making it easier to match the schematic to the actual hardware.

- **Board_3D.jpeg**  
	Here you’ll find a 3D render or photo of the board, giving you a better sense of the board’s structure, component placement, and how everything fits together in three dimensions. This is especially useful for assembly or for anyone designing upgrades.

All diagrams are provided in JPEG format for easy viewing and sharing. Together, these files give a complete picture of the electromechanical design of our car, from the logical wiring to the physical assembly.
