# Vehicle Photos

This folder is a complete photo gallery of our robot, showing it from each and every angle so you can really get a sense of its design and build quality. Whether you're curious about the details or want to see how everything fits together, these images have you covered.
## International Round:

What you'll find inside:
- **Back.jpg** - The back part of the robot where you can see how we handle Jetson's port
- **Bottom.jpg** - The underside of the car, showing the base chasis 
- **Front.jpg** - Main view of our two most important component. Lidar and Camera placement.
- **Left.jpg** and **Right.jpg** - Both sides of the vehicle, where you can check out the battery placement, profile, wheel placement, and any side-mounted component.
